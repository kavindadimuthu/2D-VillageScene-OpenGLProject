2D Village Scene - OpenGL Project
Introduction
This project is a 2D Village Scene created using OpenGL as part of the Graphics and Visualization module for my university coursework. The project demonstrates my understanding of computer graphics concepts such as rendering geometric primitives, transformations, coloring, and scene composition in a 2D environment.

*Features
  Village Landscape: The scene includes typical village elements such as houses, trees, a river, a boat, and animals, which are rendered using basic geometric shapes.
  Smooth Animations: The scene includes simple animations, like moving boats and birds, adding liveliness to the environment.
  Texturing: Basic textures have been applied to some elements to give a more realistic look.

*Technologies Used
  OpenGL: Used for rendering the 2D graphics and managing animations.
  C/C++: Programming languages used to implement the project.
  GLUT: OpenGL Utility Toolkit for windowing and input management.

*Key Concepts

  This project showcases several computer graphics techniques, including:
    Geometric Primitives: Usage of polygons, lines, and points to create the components of the scene.
    Transformations: Translation and rotation are used for animating objects in the scene (e.g., moving boat and birds).
    Coloring and Texturing: Different coloring schemes are used to represent elements like water, land, and buildings, with textures applied to parts of the scene.
    Orthographic Projection: The scene is rendered using an orthographic projection to maintain the 2D look.


Setup and Installation

  To run the project locally:
    Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/kavindadimuthu/2D-VillageScene-OpenGLProject.git
    Build and Run: Ensure you have OpenGL, GLUT, and a C++ compiler installed on your system. You can compile and run the project using Code::Blocks IDE or any other development environment that supports OpenGL.
  
  For Code::Blocks:
    Open the .cbp project file.
    Build and run the project to demonstrate.
